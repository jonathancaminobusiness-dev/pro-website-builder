# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

- Use Corepack commands from `README.md` because pnpm is not assumed to be globally installed.
- Keep generated sites flowing through `packages/domain` → `packages/orchestrator` → `packages/renderer`; agents must not write HTML/JSX directly.
- The server/API and isolated preview ports, provider safety boundary, and fixture CLI are documented in `README.md` and `apps/server/src/index.ts`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
